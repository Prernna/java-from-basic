/*What is object oriented programming?
solving a problem by creating objrcts is one of the most popular approaches in programming .this is called OOPs 
DRY -> Do not repeat yourself (focus on code reusability)

OBJECT -> object is an instantiation  of a class.When a class is defined , a template(info) is defined.Memory is allocated only after object instantiation.

How to model a problem in OOPs , identify the following:
noun -> class -> Employee
Adjective -> Attributes ->name age,salary
Verb -> Methods -> get Salary() , increment()

OOPs terminology
1.Abstraction : hiding internal details(shows only essential info!) ex: Android app 
2.Encapsulation : The act of putting various components together (in a  capsule). it simply means that the sensitive data can be hidden from the users.
3.Inheritance : The act of deriving new things from existing things. //implements DRY
4.Polymorphism->one entity more focus
